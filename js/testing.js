I apologize for the oversight. Below is a revised version of the `questionsListAAA`, `answersListAAA`, and `answerKeyListAAA` arrays for Chapter 6, based solely on the provided slide content, without incorporating personal notes. I have ensured the questions exhaust the content from the slides, focusing on key concepts, examples, and details.
